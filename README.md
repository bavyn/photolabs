# Photolabs

This project is a web application built with React as part of the Lighthouse Labs curriculum.

PhotoLabs provides users with an immersive photo browsing experience. 

Users can explore and filter photos by topic, or click on photos to reveal larger versions and discover suggested images. The heart icon enables users to mark favourites.

Axios facilitates efficient retrieval of photo and topic data from the backend server.
